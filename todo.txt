CILAssemblyManipulator:
 - EmitCall -method of E_MethodIL class emits OpCodes.Call for all non-virtual instance methods.
   This is a bug - OpCodes.Call should only be emitted for static methods, value type instance methods and this.X calls.
 - Provide Lock -properties for all cases where locking is required
 - Make the project build in WPA8.1 (will require addressing the issue of methods which can have same signature with certain generic arguments).
 - Refactor IsSubclassOf -method.
 - Add 'CILElementKind' (enum, e.g. "Assembly", "Module", "Type", etc) getter to all relevant interfaces returned by various properties and methods.
