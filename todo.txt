CILAssemblyManipulator:
 - Possible BUG: GetAllImplementedInterfaces should probably return distinct types?
 - Provide Lock -properties for all cases where locking is required
 - Make the project build in WPA8.1 (will require addressing the issue of methods which can have same signature with certain generic arguments).
 - Refactor IsSubclassOf -method.
 - Add 'CILElementKind' (enum, e.g. "Assembly", "Module", "Type", etc) getter to all relevant interfaces returned by various properties and methods.
 - Add missing values of ParameterAttributes.
